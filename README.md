# bracUniCGPAhelper
It was particularly created for keep track of my cgpa. I wanted to see my final cgpa. thus I created this one. I used lots of data structure for my own convinient. it could be 
easily done without this much hassle. I just wanted to impelement more types of data structure. I also used pdfbox library for reading pdf. 

this code basically take BRAC university gradesheet pdf and excepted CGPA as input. Then It will show what existing courses should one retake or it can be also used as cgpa calculator.
it can also calculate your current cgpa(sometimes USIS provide wrong CGPA in gradesheet).
